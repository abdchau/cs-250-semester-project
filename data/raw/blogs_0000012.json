Those added to the cast include: \nEme Ikwuakor ( Concussion , Extant ) as Gorgon – Cousin of Black Bolt, member of the Royal family, and leader of Attilan’s military. With super strong legs, complete with hooves, he can generate destructive seismic waves with a single stomp. The yin to his cousin Karnak’s yang, Gorgon would rather fight than talk to solve his problems. \nIsabelle Cornish ( Australia Day , Puberty Blues ) as Crystal – Medusa’s sister, Crystal is the youngest member of the royal family and has the ability to control the elements. Impetuous and independent she is also deeply devoted to her family. \nMike Moh ( Empire , Street Fighter: Assasin’s Fist ) as Triton – Black Bolt’s cousin, he’s calm under pressure and supremely athletic. His gift is his fish-like ability to live underwater. \nSonya Balmores ( Beyond the Break , Soul Surfer ) as Auran – Head of the Royal Guards on Attilan, a capable and no-nonsense woman. She is fiercely loyal to the King of Attilan. \nEllen Woglom ( Californication , Outlaw ) as an unnamed character – smart, intense, and focused—so focused that oftentimes, social skills take a back seat. Her job at a private aerospace company is her life, second only to her passion for all things space and lunar. She’s primed to be swept up in an adventure. \nFinally, Marvel revealed that the fan favorite Lockjaw, Crystal’s 2,000 lb canine companion with the ability to teleport, will appear in the series. \n“We’re thrilled with this cast. Eme, Isabelle, Mike, Sonya, and Ellen round out an incredible array of talent that will finally bring the Royal Family of the Inhumans to IMAX and ABC,” said Executive Producer Jeph Loeb. \n“With Eme, Isabelle, Mike, Sonya, and Ellen portraying the rest of our leading roles, we have a strong cast that is going to add tremendous depth to our Royal Family,” added Executive producer and showrunner, Scott Buck. \nThese five joins a cast that includes Hell on Wheels star Anson Mount as Black Bolt, Iwan Rheon ( Game of Thrones ,) as Maximus, Serinda Swan ( Ballers , Graceland ) as Queen Medusa and Lost alum Ken Leung as Karnak. \nSet to debut this September, a version of the first two episodes of the new ABC series will premiere exclusively in IMAX theatres for a two-week window, prior to the 8-episode network run. \nMarvel’s Inhumans is executive produced by Scott Buck ( Dexter , Marvel’s Iron Fist ) along with Jeph Loeb ( Marvel’s Daredevil , Marvel’s Jessica Jones , Marvel’s Luke Cage ) and Jim Chory ( Marvel’s Daredevil , Marvel’s Jessica Jones , Marvel’s Luke Cage ), with Buck serving as showrunner. Roel Reine ( Admiral , Black Sails ) will direct the first two episodes. The series is co-produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:42:20.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
