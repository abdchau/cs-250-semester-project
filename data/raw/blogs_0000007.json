Ever since, rumors have been spreading like wildfire as to who would replace her, with most recent reports suggesting Daft Punk. But the search is over, as the festival has just confirmed that Bey‚Äôs replacement is none other than Lady Gaga. \nLet's party in the desert! üå¥‚úåÔ∏èüé§ pic.twitter.com/2SYOv7TscF \n‚Äî xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) March 1, 2017 \n\nGaga tweeted out the news last night in the form of an updated Coachella poster along with the caption ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs party in the desert!‚Äù She is still riding high from her dually excellent performances at the Super Bowl and the Grammys, the latter of which saw her duetting with Metallica. Though hardcore members of the Beyhive may be disappointed, Gaga seems an ideal candidate to replace Beyonc√©, particularly given that the two have a storied history of working closely together.\nLady Gaga will play Coachella on April 15 and 22.
